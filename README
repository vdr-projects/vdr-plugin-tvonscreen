Description:

This plugins shows the EPG data in the typical way a TV magazine
does. The channels are shown from left to right, 3 on one screen.

You can scroll though the channels and the time, create timers,
show details, search for events and add vdradmin auto timers.

Command line options:

-l <path to logos>   optional path for the XPM channel logos,
                     if not given, <configDir>/logos is used

-v <vdradminfile>    path and filename to vdradmin at file
                     (called vdradmind.at)

TV-OnScreen has two different modes:

 - the show mode which only shows the EPG and allows scrolling
   in "big" steps
 - the edit mode which also shows the EPG but allows scrolling
   to any schedule and see details of this and create a timer
   
This is quite intuitive when you use it!


The keys in show mode (when startet):

1                      show help
Cursor up/down	       scroll the time
Cursor left/right      scroll the channels
Red/Blue               scroll the time by 1 day (blue=+1 day)
Green/Yellow           scroll the channels by 1 page (-/+ 3 channels)
7/9                    like green/yellow
8                      show the current channel
0                      go to the current time
Back                   leave
Ok                     go to edit mode
4/5/6                  jump to user specified point in time


The keys in edit mode (after pressing Ok):

Back                   go back to show mode
Cursor up/down         move to the previous/next schedule
Cursor left/right      move to the schedule in the channel left/right
Rec                    creates a timer from the current schedule
                       (opens the timer screen)
Ok                     shows details of the current schedule
                       (which allows creating a timer, auto timer or search)


The details view (after pressing Ok):

This shows the details of a seleteced schedule as you might know it from
vdr. However, the color function keys have other meanings:

Back                   returns to the show mode screen
Red                    goes to the timer screen
Record                 goes to the timer screen
Green                  search for the current schedule title, opens the search screen
Yellow                 adds this schedule title to vdradmin's auto timer


The search screen (after pressing green):

This screen shows a list of any occurence of the previously selected schedule on
the channel.

Back                   returns to the show mode screen
Blue                   returns to the show mode screen
Red                    goes to the timer screen
Record                 goes to the timer screen
Green                  shows the details of the hilighted schedule
Yellow                 searches again but this time in all channels


Requirements:

On vdr 1.2.6 ElchiAIO patches (or similar) with additional colors must be
installed.

Optional: Timeline plugin.


Important notes:

On vdr 1.2.6 the channel logos should be displayed in black/white! This setup option
will be set every time vdr starts.

Press key "1" to open the help page.
